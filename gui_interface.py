    Returns a good spread of bright and shiny colors quickly.
    
    Good color algorithm (gotten from playing with color bar in Qt)
    RED HIGH    (start)
    UP BLUE     (red high)    256
    DOWN RED    (blue high)   512 
    UP GREEN    (blue high)
    DOWN BLUE   (green high)
    UP RED      (green high)
    DOWN GREEN (ENDS AT HIGH RED)
    
    or, to put into code, there are 6 * 256 possibilities 
    (although I'd end at green == 70 to keep the last color orange so 6*256 - 70)
    They can be arrived at through simple iteration through this algorithm, or
    iteration plus jumping, or ... THIS CODE!
